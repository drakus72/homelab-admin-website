# homelab-admin-website
An all-in-one place to see your homelab information. Like a network map/diagram, in website form (mostly text based)

A demo can be found here: [testing.devsvr.net](http://testing.devsvr.net)

To use:
* Install preferred Webserver
* clone this repository
* edit the "controller.js" file to your liking
* configure webserver to serve the repo directory
* profit!!!

# Roadmap
* ~~fix individual server panel services lists~~
* ~~add link capability to server list~~
* add "About" and "Network Map" modals
* add ~~icons~~ / touchup design
* add ability to insert new content via web interface (ideally without the need for a DB service)
* make rows clickable (gracefully)
* fix the "active" issue with PM tabs
